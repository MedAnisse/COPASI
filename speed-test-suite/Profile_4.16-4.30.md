## Abstract
Recent changes to COPASI source code have resulted in a general performance increase. The 
aim of this work is to quantify the effective speed gains achieved in different simulation 
and analysis tasks. This is done by using specific models that challenge these tasks and are 
especially long to execute. This set of models and tasks will be useful for future 
comparisons to continue documenting the evolution of the software performance.
